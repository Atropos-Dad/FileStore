**Weekly Report Form -** *Week 1 -- Jack Casey - 27th June, Friday*

Weekly Update:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  What I achieved this This week, I focused on improving file upload capabilities in
  week:                Oak Runner. I implemented comprehensive multipart form-data
                       support, allowing workflows to handle file and binary uploads
                       (such as Discord attachments and image uploads) directly
                       through the Arazzo spec. I also added better binary response
                       handling and refactored content-type routing for easier
                       extension and debugging. These changes ensure more workflows
                       are possible and improve reliability. I also reviewed and
                       tested related APIs and contributed feedback to the team.
                       (See [[PR
                       #255]{.underline}](https://github.com/jentic/oak/pull/255))
  -------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  What I will focus on Next week, I plan to add unit tests for the new multipart and
  next week:           binary handling features to ensure long-term stability. I'll
                       also work on documentation to help others use these new
                       capabilities, and continue exploring ways to make Oak Runner
                       more robust and user-friendly. Additionally, I'll support the
                       team with any integration issues and help review new workflow
                       ideas.

  Any blockers:        Some edge cases with binary data and missing test coverage
                       need to be addressed. More feedback from users would be
                       helpful.
